Zydeco is a creole-compliant (at least mostly!) wikitext parser, written in PHP.

For info on the Creole markup language, see http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Home


Usage: see index.php

Known incompatibilities:
 - Doesn't allow whitespace in front of headings, table rows, or lists (required by Creole)
 - Allows the tilde character to occur in URLs, both within explicit links and within
	automatically parsed URLs (because this would break urls for apache's userdir module,
	which are of the format http://host/~username/ )

 - Doesn't implement the addition of attributes to tables when allowing mediawiki-style tables
 - Also doesn't support the inline-tr syntax of mediawiki tables
